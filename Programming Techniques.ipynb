    "Since there will be many lines of code within a single cell for our app, I recommend a few notebook extensions that will make your lives easier. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Hinterland** - Makes suggestions for autocompleting your code\n",
    "2. **Codefolding** - Collapse chunks of code (e.g., comments, functions) with a dropdown button \n",
    "3. **Toggle all line numbers** - Adds line numbers to each cell of your notebook (can be useful for debugging)\n",
    "4. **Table of Contents** - Makes navigating (organized) notebooks easier\n",
    "\n",
    "To get the jupyter notebook extensions, open up Anaconda Prompt and type `pip install jupyter_contrib_nbextensions`. Once installed, open up a notebook, go to the Edit tab, and then at the bottom click on **nbextensions config**. This will open up a separate tab in your browswer where you can enable a variety of extensions."

    "We'll start with an example. Imagine you have a list of numbers, and you want to loop through them and append the square of each number. With a traditional loop, here is one way we could approach this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python \n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "\n",
    "squares = []\n",
    "for num in numbers:\n",
    "    square = num*num \n",
    "    squares.append(square)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "With a list comprehension, we can acheive the same result with code that is much more concise. It is also generally faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "\n",
    "squares = [num*num for num in numbers] \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To use a list comprehension, you essentially write a traditional loop, but backwards. You begin with the the result you want, followed by what you're looping over. In the above example, we want the square, so `num*num` will be first. (You could of course also do `num**2`.) Then, we fill in the rest with what we're looping over (i.e., the first part of the traditional loop). \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that it doesn't matter what you call the iterator. We could have easily have written the following as well:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python \n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "\n",
    "squares = [i*i for i in numbers]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### List Comprehensions: Conditional logic\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you have a list of strings and you want to filter out some words. We will call this list `tokens` and the words to remove `filter_words`. \n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "tokens = ['I', 'want', 'to', 'file', 'a', 'claim']\n",
    "filter_words = ['I', 'to', 'a']\n",
    "```\n",

    "```Python\n",
    "clean_tokens = []\n",
    "for token in tokens:\n",
    "    if token not in filter_words:\n",

    "Notice that the condition goes at the **end** of the line.\n",
    "\n",
    "### List Comprehensions: Nested Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's extend the previous example by imagining we have a list of tokenized documents and we still want to remove any `filter_words` in them.\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "docs = [['I', 'want', 'to', 'file', 'a', 'claim'], \n",
    "        ['speak', 'to', 'a', 'representative']]\n",
    "\n",
    "filter_words = ['I', 'to', 'a']\n",

    "clean_docs = []\n",
    "for doc in docs:\n",
    "    for token in doc:\n",
    "        if token not in filter_words:\n",
    "            clean_docs.append(token)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a list comprehension:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "clean_docs = [[token for token in doc if token not in filter_words] for doc in docs]\n",
    "```\n",

    "## Functions: Overview\n",

    "\n",
    "## Functions: Docstrings\n",
    "First off, it is good practice to write a docstring for all functions that span more than a few lines. A docstring is a description written at the beginning of a function that is designated with triple quotes `''' '''`. It describes what the function does and lists the arguments that are passed into the function. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example:\n",

    "    '''\n",
    "    \n",
    "    squares = [num*num for num in lst]\n",
    "    \n",
    "    return(squares)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Functions: return()\n",
    "\n",
    "Your functions won't give you the result you want if you don't use `return()` at the end. You always want to have `return` at the end of your functions, unless your function is just for printing off things with `print()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of a function without `return` and just `print`:\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
