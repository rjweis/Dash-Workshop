# Dash Workshop

Part of my practicum project at the Institute for Advanced Analytics has involved creating a dashboard with the Dash module in Python.
I helped my team get used to the framework by preparing and giving a workshop on Dash. The `Programming Techniques` notebook mainly covers list 
comprehensions and functions, and the `Dash Tutorial` notebook provides a beginner's guide to using Dash.
